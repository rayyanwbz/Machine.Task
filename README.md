# Titanic Machine Learning Project

# Machine.Task
This project explores the Titanic dataset, aiming to analyze and predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the ill-fated voyage. Using machine learning techniques, we will delve into the factors that contributed to survival, providing insights into historical data while honing our data analysis skills.


## Overview

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about passengers, including features such as:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: Full name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age in years.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Ticket fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Goals

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualization.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict survival.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## Getting Started

To run this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook to load the data and begin analysis.

## Conclusion

This project not only aims to predict survival on the Titanic but also serves as a foundational exercise in data analysis and machine learning, applicable to various datasets and problems.
